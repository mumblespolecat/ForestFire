<p><strong>GameOfLife Broken Vesion</strong></p>

<p>This is released to the students of VR MSC as broken code example. Any one using this not in the university will be disappionted as its incomplete.</p>
<hr>
<p>Since the initial setting up of the reposiory, I have added features to the 2D and 3D Forest Fire simulations as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wind to both 2D and 3D, with both speed and direction, which has a noticable effect on the speed and direction of the spread of the fire.</li>
<li>Random river / water feature generation, which as it has no fuel, acts as a fire break.  Works well in 2D.</li>
<li>Same river / water feature gereration added to 3D, but although it looks good on both the 3D ground and the minimap, prior to starting the simulation, breaks as soon as it is un-paused.  Something in the code (as yet unknown) turns all the water to burnt ground.  The fire break properties remain, and I guess I could have spun it, but it isn't quite right and I have no more time to look at it right now.  So it is incomplete, for now.  Hopefully not forever.</li>
</ul>
